        <h1>Weather On Point!</h1>
        <h5>The analysis of weather trends on latitude lines</h5>
        <p>
            Weather on planet earth is a constantly changing yet local experience across planet earth. However, trends have been observed while watching weather trends from north to south. With that in mind, I have analysed regular trends in weather on the different latitude lines. Weather in this case will be analysed based on 4 aspects; cloud cover, humidity, wind, and temperature. These four aspects were analysed based on latitude lines, checked for significance and graphed out. I led this research on this questions: to what extent does weather differ accross different latitude lines?; To what degree does weather trends relate to distance to the equator?; Which aspects of weather seem to support trends the most?
